# Current Project Status
## Done:
* Completed layout for all activities
* Camera activity successfully sends the image capture to the firebase account for backup storage
* New announcement gets added to database as a text file
* Announcement file name gets retreived by the app but not the actual file content

## Still need to implement:
* Getting the images from firebase and displaying them in the gallery 
* Creating a design layout for the images to be displayed in the gallery
* Calendar activity
* Need to retreive the announcement from firebase and display on home screen

## Uncertainties:
* Not sure how to specify which firebase account to save to by default.
