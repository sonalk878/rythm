# Current Project Status
## Done:
* Completed layout for all activities
* Camera activity successfully sends the image capture to the firebase account for backup storage



## Still need to implement:
* Getting the images from firebase and displaying them in the gallery 
* Adding announcements and saving them in firebase as well for backup storage
* Calendar activity

## Uncertainties:
* Not sure how to specify which firebase account to save to by default.
